1. Should be making a new file? then make the template, grep for each template and align it up then? 
2. My plan was to make a script that takes in user input of the hpp file and use can output their destination file,
    we make a copy of that file while going in and putting banner of the file above the appropriate spot


Looking for class and namespace:
grep -i "::" HPP_FILE.cpp| cut -d " " -f 2
--> A::B::C::D::ImaginaryClass

grep -i "::" HPP_FILE.cpp| gawk '{print $2}'|head -1| cut -d ":" -f 1
-> A

grep -i "::" HPP_FILE.cpp| gawk '{print $2}'|head -1| cut -d ":" -f 3
-> B

grep -i "::" HPP_FILE.cpp| gawk '{print $2}'|head -1| sed 's/::/_/g' 
-> A_B_C_D_immaginaryClass

grep -i "::" HPP_FILE.cpp| gawk '{print $2}'|head -1| sed 's/::/_/g' | cut -d "_" -f 1-4
